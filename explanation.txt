**HTTP Response Splitting Attack Explanation**
This attack exploits a vulnerability in the course_selector page where user input is not properly sanitized
before being embedded in HTTP response headers. By injecting CRLF sequences (%0d%0a) in the URL parameters,
we can prematurely terminate the original response and inject a second, malicious response.
The attack includes specific headers like Content-Length and Last-Modified to ensure proper caching.
When successful, this causes the proxy to cache our injected content (our ID: 322314303) for the target
page (67607.html).

**HTTP Request Smuggling Attack Explanation**
This attack exploits the different ways Apache 2.0.45 proxy and web server interpret HTTP request boundaries
when both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are present. The proxy server sees Content-Length: 0
and treats the request as empty, while the web server processes it as chunked encoding.
This desynchronization allows us to "smuggle" a request to /poison.html, which the proxy caches.
When a subsequent request for /page_to_poison.html arrives, the proxy returns the cached content
from /poison.html instead of the actual page content.
